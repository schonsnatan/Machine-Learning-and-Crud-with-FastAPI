# House Price Prediction API

This project implements a FastAPI application to predict the estimated price of a house based on its size, number of bedrooms, and number of parking spaces. The Machine Learning model is trained on a small sample dataset and saved as a .pkl file, which is then consumed by the API.

# ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI for the API
- scikit-learn for training the ML model
- joblib for saving and loading the model
- uvicorn to run the API server

# ðŸ“– Interactive API Documentation

- Once the server is running, you can access:
- Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- Redoc: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

## Note
*fastapi_tests* and *async* folders are just for test and learning purposes
